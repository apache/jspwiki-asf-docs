## Project Activity:

disclosures, fixed on that release. This release included JSPWIKI-1114,
an external contribution noted on previous report.

## Community Health:

Uptick of e-mails at dev@jspwiki.apache.org most probably related to 2.11.0.M5
release. Uptick of e-mails at user@jspwiki.apache.org due to more than usual
amount of questions and follow ups on July.

No questions unanswered on MLs, project remains with enough oversight, with 
usual slow pace of development.
