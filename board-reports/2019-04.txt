## Description: 
 - A feature-rich and extensible WikiWiki engine built around the standard
JEE components (Java, servlets, JSP).
   
## Issues: 
 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 - This quarter we saw 5 vulnerability reports, 2 of them where declined. We
ended up having the 2018/Q4 (2.11.0.M1) release on January, 2.11.0.M2 to 
address one of the vulnerability reports and not too much later 2.11.0.M3 to
address the other two vulnerabilities. TL-DR: quite busy quarter for our
regular pace.
   
## Health report: 
 - We continue to have a slight decline of people subscribed to MLs. OTOH, 
we've had 5 vulnerability reports which somehow translates in people 
interested enough on Apache JSPWiki, and we were able to pull the releases,
so I'd say there's enough oversight. Questions do get answered on MLs too.

- Regarding contributions, we've received this quarter a couple of small 
PRs which made into master, and a TikaSearchProvider to index a whole lot 
more types of attachments (JSPWIKI-469), which should also get into master 
within a short time.
