## Description: 
 - A feature-rich and extensible WikiWiki engine built around the standard
JEE components (Java, servlets, JSP).
   
## Issues: 
 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 - It's been another quiet quarter, with only a couple of commits needed to
   complete the decouple of the markup parsing and rendering, so that other
   alternatives can be used
 
 - As something stripped from @dayjob, Markdown support will hopefully 
   arrive next weeks (see "Markdown support" thread at dev@jspwiki.a.o for
   details [1]), at least for discussion and study. Scope and things 
   remaining to be done still ongoing at dev@jspwiki.a.o
   
## Health report: 
 - Another quiet quarter, but enough people from PMC show up to provide
   enough oversight. 

 - Several ideas being discussed at user@jspwiki.a.o to increase 
   contributions [2], namely:
   * move to Github as primary repo
   * lower committership barrier by granting commits rights to 
     a) any ASF committer 
     b) any other people who simply asks for it
     c) adopting something similar to a release train and release 
        master every four months or so
