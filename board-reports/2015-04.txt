Report from the Apache JSPWiki project

## Description:

   A feature-rich and extensible WikiWiki engine built around the standard 
        J2EE components (Java, servlets, JSP).
  
## Activity:

 - Again, slow pace of development, including (but not limited to) some
   interesting functionalities committed into trunk:
   * Portable builds of JSPWiki.
   * Complete rewrite of AJAX functionality.
   * JSPWiki configurable via environment variables, which allows easy
     dockerization.
