## Project Activity:
We received two vulnerability reports this quarter, of which one of them
resulted in an actual vulnerability, already fixed in master.

As a result from a thread on the user ML, we also have introduced support
of custom wiki event listeners on our public API, and squashed a bug
regarding the content of some wiki events.

We still have to release 2.12.2, but we'd like to introduce in it a big
internal refactor so that JSPWiki can benefit from virtual threads support
when running under JDK-21. This work is tracked at [#1].

## Community Health:
Work on latest master shows commits from 2 different commiters.

Other than that, we got the usual amount of emails (that is, not too much). No
unanswered questions, and there is enough people appearing on the ML and 
providing project oversight.
