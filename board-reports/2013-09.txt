JSPWiki is a Java-based wiki engine

Anything the board should be aware of?
---------------------------------------
Still having one issue noted on the past report, regarding the 
transfer of Incubator resources to TLP: we're currently unable to edit
the website, unless we do it directly on production/ URL. Following up 
this issue with Infra at INFRA-6611.

Releases / Development
----------------------
Last release on 15th May, 2013

Little activity regarding development this month.

Development has been mainly focused on three points: replacing oscache
with ehcache, simplifying JSPWiki configuration via a custom properties 
file and fixing the integration tests.

The VM for the live JSPWikis has just been created, so work on setting 
up the wikis should begin shortly.
