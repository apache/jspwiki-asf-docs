Leading open source WikiWiki engine, feature-rich and built around standard

## Project Activity:
This quarter we received 6 security vulnerability reports, of which 5 of them
were rejected, and the other one acknowledged and already fixed in master. We
will announce this vulnerability after releasing 2.11.0, which should happen
on Q4.

Also, we got to publish Apache JSPWiki images on Docker Hub, the SpamFilter
gained the ability to ignore certain groups (admins, editors, etc.), some
dependency updates. Finally, several PRs with minor code improvements from 
one contributor were merged into master.

## Community Health:
A few questions (answered) on MLs, and enough people to provide project 
oversight. Project activity is low, but hopefully will spin up after 2.11.0
release.
