## Project Activity:
Most notable activity this quarter was the 2.12.3 release. After that, the
jakarta branch was finally merged into master, followed by raising the 
minimum required JDK to 17.

2.12.3 release and 3.0.0 requirements have been the main topics on the MLs,
which translate into an increase of activity when compared to previous 
quarters.

## Community Health:
Work on latest master shows commits from one committer + one contributor
(this was mostly last quarter's work on the jakarta branch).

No questions unanswered on MLs, although they continue to have very little 
traffic.
