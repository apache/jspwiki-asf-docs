## Description: 
   A feature-rich and extensible WikiWiki engine built around the standard  
        JEE components (Java, servlets, JSP). 
   
## Issues: 
 - Although almost no dev activity on this quarter (see below), we think 
   there are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 - Almost no SVN activity this quarter. 
 - Release 2.10.2 blocked due to developers' lack of time on the project, 
   (due to being developed on a free-time basis) holidays, etc., but 
   should be doable on this quarter.
 - No questions unattended/unanswered on MLs.
   
## Health report: 
 - Although there hasn't been almost any development activity this quarter, 
   we don't think there's reason to concern: Project is stable / mature 
   with a slow pace of development, plus there's enough people to oversee 
   the project (vote on releases, answer questions, etc.). 
 - Activity is expected to be picked up once we release 2.10.2.
