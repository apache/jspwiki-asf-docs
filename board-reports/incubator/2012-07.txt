2012 July JSPWiki Incubator status report

JSPWiki has been incubating since September 2007.

JSPWiki is a JSP-based wiki program.

Still following the objetive of making the first Apache release:

4 JIRA issues were fixed since last period, the project 
website has been revamped, and few other niceties & fixes have got 
into trunk (for example lucene library was upgraded to 3.6.0).

2 Release candidates have been made, but they didn't succeed
because of technical issues. Hopefully the third RC will became
the first ASF release.

The main issues blocking graduation keep being the same as 
in the last report: resolution acceptance, community and IPMC 
graduation vote, the latter one requiring at least one ASF 
release.

The developer list currently has ?? subscribers; and the
user list has ??? subscribers.
