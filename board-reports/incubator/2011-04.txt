2011 April JSPWiki Incubator status report

JSPWiki has been incubating since September 2007.

JSPWiki is a JSP-based wiki program.

A few minor bugs were fixed.

No progress in the incubation process. The project still needs to
make an official Apache release.  Very few developers seem to have
time to dedicate for JSPWiki.

There appears to be a lack of interest in the new releases, though
there is still activity on the users list, which shows that people
are using JSPWiki.

The developer list currently has 96 subscribers; and the
user list has 193 subscribers.  There is no significant change.
