2007-December JSPWiki Incubator status report

JSPWiki has been incubating since September 2007.

JSPWiki is a JSP-based wiki program.

The final JSPWiki LGPL release has been postponed due to a large
number of security vulnerabilities that were disclosed to us
right before the release, so unfortunately that has also delayed
the move of the codebase under ASF's infrastructure.

The JSPWiki user community is in the process of transition from 
outside Apache. There are close to 100 subscribers to the user list.
The developer list has meanwhile continued growing, and new people
have come forward with patches and expressions of interest on
working on the code.
