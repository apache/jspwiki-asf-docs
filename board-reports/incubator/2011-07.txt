2011 April JSPWiki Incubator status report

JSPWiki has been incubating since September 2007.

JSPWiki is a JSP-based wiki program.

There were 6 bugs fixed.
And also some progress in the incubation process, the last open issue
 (JSPWIKI-636 Clean unit test builds) was also fixed.
But still no activity to make an official Apache release.  
Very few developers seem to have time to dedicate for JSPWiki.

There appears to be a lack of interest in the new releases, though
there is still activity on the users list, which shows that people
are using JSPWiki.

The developer list currently has 93 subscribers; and the
user list has 192 subscribers.
