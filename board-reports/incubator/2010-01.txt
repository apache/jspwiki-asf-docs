2010 January JSPWiki Incubator status report

JSPWiki has been incubating since September 2007.

JSPWiki is a JSP-based wiki program.

Significant progress was made in Stripesifying the jsp's.
We also introduced a new content-inspection package and integrated CAPTCHA. 
We upgraded to the priha 0.7.0-alpha release which passes all tests 
from the JSR-170 test suite, and offers better performance.

A number of bugs were fixed and 27 new unit tests were added, the current unit 
test compliance has dropped a bit to 96.8 %.  

Of the 27 items on the graduation checklist, still only 18 are complete, 
so in that area there has been no progress. 
All open items are documentation and ASF process and infrastructure related.
There still is no 3.0.0-incubating-alpha1 release.

The developer list currently has 82 members, a minor decrease from 86; and the
user list has 191 members, an increase from 187.
