2012 October JSPWiki Incubator status report

JSPWiki has been incubating since September 2007.

JSPWiki is a JSP-based wiki program.

Still following the objective of making the first Apache release:

A few JIRA issues were raised in this period due to incorrect
handling of external dependencies. They have been fixed, so there 
aren't any other technical issues blocking a release. A new RC and
a release vote has been cast in jspwiki-dev, with 10 +1 (6 from
PPMC members). However, we don't have any IPMC vote yet, so the release
thread was forwarded to general on Friday 26th. 

It's likely that we will have our first Apache release during the
first weeks of October. 

The main issues blocking graduation keep being the same as 
in the last report: resolution acceptance, community and IPMC 
graduation vote, the latter requiring at least one ASF 
release.

The developer list currently has 91 subscribers; and the
user list has 186 subscribers.
