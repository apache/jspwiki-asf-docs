2008-October JSPWiki Incubator status report

JSPWiki has been incubating since September 2007.

JSPWiki is a JSP-based wiki program.

During the past three months, the JSPWiki community seems to still enjoy 
a steady increase.  The developer list now has 66 names, an increase 
of 12%.  The user list is now 152 people strong, a growth of 7% since the last
report.

The first beta of JSPWiki 2.8 (which is the Apache-licensed version of 2.6)
has been released, and it is missing only a few key patches to be a full release.
This, however, won't be an Apache release (as it is meant to be backwards
compatible with 2.x series, which means keeping the old package structure).
Despite of this, we're practicing the Apache processes of voting and approving
releases.

Graduation depends chiefly of three things:

* Stable release of 2.8, so we can concentrate on 3.0 process
* Making a successful 3.0 release, including
	* Renaming of all packages to org.apache.*
	* Taking the new API into use
* Making sure all the legal bits and pieces are in order (i.e. the status file)
