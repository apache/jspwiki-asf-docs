2013 April JSPWiki Incubator status report

JSPWiki has been incubating since September 2007.

JSPWiki is a JSP-based wiki program.

The most significant movements in this period have been:
- ongoing vote to release Apache JSPWiki (incubating) 2.9.1
- 1 patch incorporated into trunk, 15 JIRAs resolved

Compared to the last period, the traffic on jspwiki-dev has been halved, 
whereas the traffic at jspwiki-user has increased slightly.  

The main issues blocking graduation are: resolution acceptance, community and 
IPMC graduation vote. If the release vote is succesful, we're thinking on
discussing leaving the Incubator + graduate as TLP

The developer list currently has (?) subscribers; and the user list has (?) 
subscribers.
