2013 July JSPWiki Incubator status report

JSPWiki

Java-based wiki engine

JSPWiki has been incubating since 2007-09-17.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. IPMC vote (?, currently running)
  2. 
  3. 

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?
* We currently have open some JIRAs with Infra. Specifically, having 
  INFRA-5588 (Ubuntu VM for JSPWiki) solved would be a great +1 in terms of 
  community building, and would be a really nice way of entering TLP.

How has the community developed since the last report?
* Community graduation vote passed with 16 +1 (http://s.apache.org/uM)
* There was a call for completing i18n files, which has been fastly addresed 
  by community: Chinese, Portuguese, French, Italian, Brazilian and Russian 
  language files have been completed completed by community
* Mail activity has tripled previous quarter at jspwiki-dev, 2.9.1-incubating 
  release and graduation being responsible of part of the increase of this 
  activity. jspwiki-user traffic has decreased a bit, though.

How has the project developed since the last report?
* Apache JSPWiki 2.9.1-incubating released on May, 15th
* 8 JIRAs resolved in this period
* Switch to Maven as build tool almost complete
* Upgraded some libraries

Date of last release: 15/05/2013
