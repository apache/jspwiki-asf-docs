2013 January JSPWiki Incubator status report

JSPWiki has been incubating since September 2007.

JSPWiki is a JSP-based wiki program.

The most significant movements in this period have been:
- Apache JSPWiki (incubating) 2.9.0 released in December 
- 4 patches incorporated into trunk
- new mentor - Siegfried Goeschl
- vote to ask Glen Mazza (gmazza@apache.org) as PPMC & committer passed, with 
  Glen agreeing to join in.

The traffic on jspwiki-dev has kept growing these months, whereas the traffic at
jspwiki-user has remained more or less the same. 13 JIRA issues were also fixed 
in this period. Lastly, work on an API to expose JSPWiki internals has started. 

The main issues blocking graduation are: resolution acceptance, community and 
IPMC graduation vote. However, we feel that in this period we've strongly 
advanced towards graduation.

The developer list currently has (?) subscribers; and the user list has (?) 
subscribers.
