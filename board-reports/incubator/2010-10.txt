2010 October JSPWiki Incubator status report

JSPWiki has been incubating since September 2007.

JSPWiki is a JSP-based wiki program.

Only a few minor bugs were fixed.

No progress in the incubation process. The project still needs to
make an official Apache release.

Things have slowed down the last few months for an unknown reason.
Also the mailing lists are very quiet.

There is still considerable interest in the project.
The developer list currently has 90 subscribers, no change; and the
user list has 195 subscribers, no change.
