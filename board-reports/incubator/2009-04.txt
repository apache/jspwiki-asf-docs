2009 April JSPWiki Incubator status report

JSPWiki has been incubating since September 2007.

JSPWiki is a JSP-based wiki program.

During the past three months, the JSPWiki community has still continued to increase. 
The developer list now has 82 names, a modest increase from 72 the last time, and the 
user list is now 167 people strong, ten more than three months ago.

The big push now is for our graduation.  The biggest hurdles have been overcome:
The packages are now called "org.apache.wiki" [please see Tomcat bug
https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=46462 to see why we couldn't
use org.apache.jspwiki]; JSPWiki has switched to the Stripes framework; and we
have switched to use the JCR backend (e.g. Apache Jackrabbit).
As a result of a vote, the support for webdav has been dropped.
The fairly old jsonrpc has been replaced by jabsorb.

However, the trunk is in a fairly immature state.  For example, it is not deployable
at all, which means that nobody can yet use the trunk for its intended purpose.  
Our main concern is to stabilize the code to some state where it would be 
actually usable before making a release.

The biggest slowdown is simply the fact that JSPWiki is (still) a completely volunteer-
developed project, with nobody actually receiving any money for its development.  While
this is great in the sense that development is relatively easy to join, and communities
are not overrun by corporate requirements, it also means that the committer's priorities 
often conflict with the object of speedy graduation.

We are planning to have an "alpha" grade release as our first official Apache release,
after which we should be fairly ready for graduation.
