2012 April JSPWiki Incubator status report

JSPWiki has been incubating since September 2007.

JSPWiki is a JSP-based wiki program.

As a result of discussing in the dev-list, the objectives
for graduation have changed: the first Apache release
will be based on 2.8 (package-renamed), which is 
battle-tested, being the plan to evolve from there.

4 JIRA issues were fixed since last period, and tests are
now part of the main build.

The main issues blocking graduation now are resolution 
acceptance, and community and IPMC graduation vote.

The developer list currently has ?? subscribers; and the
user list has ??? subscribers.
