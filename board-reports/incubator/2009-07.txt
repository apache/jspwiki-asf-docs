2009 April JSPWiki Incubator status report

JSPWiki has been incubating since September 2007.

JSPWiki is a JSP-based wiki program.

During the past three months, the JSPWiki community has not increased significantly.
The developer list now has 83 names, one more than the last time, and the 
user list is now 178 people strong, eleven more than three months ago.

We are completing the checklist on the graduation, but things have slowed down
due to developers taking time on personal issues - some get married, some get children,
some just enjoy holidays.  JSPWiki is still fully a volunteer project, which shows.
The checklist is kept in JIRA, at http://is.gd/1qkV8

Most of the checklist items are of practical nature rather than real showstoppers;
there is some uncertainty as to when things can be called "done".

The development of the 3.0 still continues in the SVN, albeit at a reduced speed due
to the aforementioned issues.
