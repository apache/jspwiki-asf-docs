2008-January JSPWiki Incubator status report

JSPWiki has been incubating since September 2007.

JSPWiki is a JSP-based wiki program.

JSPWiki 2.6 LGPL was finally released just before Christmas, so the development
could finally be moved to the Apache Incubation SVN. The code is expected
to be transferred to the Apache repository within the next few weeks.

The incubator web site was also created.

Community

The developer and user mailing lists continue to have strong activity,
with a few dozen active participants and over a hundred monitoring the lists.
