2009 January JSPWiki Incubator status report

JSPWiki has been incubating since September 2007.

JSPWiki is a JSP-based wiki program.

During the past three months, the JSPWiki community has increased somewhat, 
but the growth seems to level off.  The developer list now has 72 names, 
a modest increase from 66 the last time, and the user list is now 157 
people strong, five more than three months ago.

JSPWiki 2.8 (an Apache-licensed version of 2.6) was made successfully, and
even a couple of bugfix releases have been done.  This means that work on the
3.0 - the first Apache-branded release - is currently strongly underway.

A minor problem was encountered when a widespread bug in Jasper means
that we cannot use our initial choice of "org.apache.jspwiki" as the 
package name without sacrificing compatibility with the majority of 
servlet containers.  The community is still debating a couple of options.

Graduation depends on:

* Renaming org.jspwiki to conform with the org.apache naming scheme
* Making a successful 3.0 release, which is currently being tracked at
  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JSPWIKI-461
* Making sure all the legal bits and pieces are in order (i.e. the status file)
