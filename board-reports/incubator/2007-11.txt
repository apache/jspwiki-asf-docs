2007-November JSPWiki Incubator status report

JSPWiki infrastructure has been moved over to Apache: the issue trackers
and the mailing lists are now fully operational.  We've also started the process
of getting ICLAs and Software Grants from all the previous contributors who still
hold copyright over the code.

All committers identified in the original proposal plus the mentors
have commit access and are on the private mailing list.

The dev alias has attracted a couple dozen outside members.

The final LGPL-licensed JSPWiki release is almost ready, after which we will
start moving code into the Apache SVN.  This is to minimize having to maintain two
separate branches, one LGPL and one Apache -licensed.

The questions on how jspwiki.org domain and the jspwiki.org websites should
be transferred to Apache have not yet been discussed.
