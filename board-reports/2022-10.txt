## Project Activity:
Quiet two-month quarter, with no code merged into master. It was 
discussed the need of upgrading JDK, so next release will be 2.12.0,
which will require JDK-11. This change should get into master by
the time of the Board meeting.

We got one vulnerability report, done directly through github, which
was rejected. Still pending to reach the issuer so next reports do
get submitted through the appropiate channels.

Last release was 2.11.3 on 2022-08-02.

## Community Health:
Traffic on both MLs had a decrease compared with last quarter, most
probably due to being a quiet-code quarter. 

Community wise, we got one plugin submitted through dev@j.a.o, which 
should at least get uploaded to jspwiki-wiki.a.o. Also, an emeritus 
PMC member is working on a new ReferenceManager implementation, based 
on JGraphT.

We have a handful of PRs awaiting to be merged.

There is enough people to provide project oversight.
