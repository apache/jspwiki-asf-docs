## Description: 
   A feature-rich and extensible WikiWiki engine built around the standard  
        JEE components (Java, servlets, JSP). 
   
## Issues: 
 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time. 
   
## Activity: 
 - user@j.a.o held a thread named "Open Discussion - How to increasing 
   JSPWiki publicity". As a result of that we know have one more PMC &
   committer, who is taking care of both project's Facebook and Twitter
   accounts.
 - A faculty member from Massachusetts approached dev@j.a.o asking for 
   some tasks to be done, which could be used on a computer science senior 
   seminar course.
 - 2.10.2 was finally released, which resulted into an increase of activity
 - Development after 2.10.2 has been focused mostly on improving JSPWiki's 
   default template. 
 - There were commits by three different people on this period.
 - We had one security vulnerability report, but it was dismissed.
   
## Health report: 
 - Overall, the project is healthy, but with a slow pace of development.

   plus FB and Twitter accounts, and on dev because of 2.10.2 + JIRA activity.
