## Project Activity:
2.12.0 release happened this quarter, which fixed some XSS vulnerabilities and 
also uplifted the JDK requirement up to JDK-11. We also got a couple of 
vulnerability reports, which were discarded and, after a query on the dev ML,
we realized that the workflow approval area wasn't working as expected since a 
lot of releases, so we fixed it and we're preparing a 2.12.1 release.


## Community Health:
Most important thing happening in this area, we finally added a PMC/committer
to our roster! After being engaged on the MLs for some time and sending some 
PRs, Arturo Bernal joined JSPWiki PMC on June. He'll also be acting as RM for
2.12.1, so that's another positive thing.

Other than that, we got the usual amount of emails (that is, not too much). No
unanswered questions, and there is enough people appearing on the ML and 
providing project oversight. Traffic on dev list reflects mostly PRs movement.
