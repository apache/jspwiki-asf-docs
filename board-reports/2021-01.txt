## Project Activity:
2.11.0.M8 was released on 2020-12-13, which featured fixes for problems 
on Searches and Workflows' persistence on disk, introduced on 2.11.0.M7.

This release also contained features provided by community members: 
completed translations for french and german, and another patch reworking
a previous fix in one of the plugins bundled with JSPWiki. 

After 2.11.0.M8, activity has been focused on attending several PRs 
created by the dependabot (dependabot configuration was provided by another
contributor). We also got a contribution regarding the official documentation,
where the Docker page got a big rework.

2.11.0 should be the next planned release.

## Community Health:
There's enough project oversight, although project activity is low.

We are looking for some continuity on previously noted contributors, as they 
may end up becoming potential PMC members / committers.
