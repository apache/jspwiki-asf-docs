## Project Activity:
This quarter we released 2.11.0.M6, which was mostly dev-oriented. It also
contained one pull request from a contributor. Current development right now
is also focused in a big refactor of one of the core JSPWiki classes
(JSPWIKI-120). Current pace of development continues to be slow, as JSPWiki
 keeps being worked on free time.

## Community Health:
This quarter has been a very quiet one, which shows up in the traffic decrease
on both mailing lists. This could be in part explained because development
itself has seen less movement this month, but having quarters with less
traffic is not that unsual.

Questions on MLs get answers and we have enough people to cut releases, so
projects remains with enough oversight.
