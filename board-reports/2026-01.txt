## Project Activity:
Alex O'Ree joined JSPWiki this quarter, bringing a lot of energy to the 
project.

Most notable activity this quarter revolved around fixing long-standing 
issues, security findings, administration-related capabilities and 
dependency updates.

A big portion of the security findings have been sitting on JIRA for a 
very long time, and never were discussed on private. Most probably they
were filed on JIRA under incubation, but ended up falling through the 
cracks.

We're still discussing one security issue, after which we will focus on
releasing 3.0.0.

## Community Health:
Work on latest master shows commits from three committers.

No questions unanswered on MLs, although they continue to have very little 
traffic, aside from JIRA/GitHub generated mails.
