## Description: 
 - A feature-rich and extensible WikiWiki engine built around the standard
JEE components (Java, servlets, JSP).
   
## Issues: 
 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 - Compared to last report, there has been an up-tick in activity this 
   quarter, where activity has been focused on these areas:
   * Initial support for Markdown: there is a new custom parser + renderer
     for Markdown, although not complete yet (see 
     https://jspwiki-wiki.apache.org/Wiki.jsp?page=Markdown%20Support for 
     details)
   * Fixed a bug regarding the renderer cache (JSPWIKI-1064)
   * Tests were migrated from JUnit 3 to JUnit 4
   * Generation of a test-jar, with several with utilities to ease testing
     of JSPWiki custom components.
 - No questions unanswered on MLs, with at least 3 people from PMC showing 
   up there.
   
## Health report: 
 - Last report highlighted some ideas to increase contributions:
   * move to Github as primary repo: done; we're also encouraging the use of 
     jspwiki as a topic on GitHub to increase contributions' visibility.
   * adopting something similar to a release train: we should release 2.10.3
     next February.
   * lower committership barrier by granting commits rights to 
     a) any ASF committer.
     b) any other people who simply asks for it.
     Other than discussing the idea, we haven't done anything, as nobody new
     has showed up yet..
