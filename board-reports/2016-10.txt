## Description: 
 - A feature-rich and extensible WikiWiki engine built around the standard 
JEE components (Java, servlets, JSP).
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time. There's enough 
people to provide oversight.
   
## Activity: 
 - Source code was migrated from SVN to Git (+ its integrations) in order to 
ease contributions.

 - We've also talked about moving jspwiki.a.o from ASF's CMS to JSPWiki 
(https://s.apache.org/PFXI) as a) historically it's always been that way, and
b) we could use it as showcase, having a separate wiki doesn't seem to be 
enough (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JSPWIKI-1030). I volunteered 
for the task (moving content, copyright compliance, asking infra) but haven't
had time this quarter. Hopefully this will change on the upcoming quarter.
