Report from the Apache JSPWiki committee

## Description:
   A feature-rich and extensible WikiWiki engine built around the standard 
        J2EE components (Java, servlets, JSP).
  
## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
  
## Activity:
 - Quiet quarter regarding ML activity, although conversations on releasing
   2.10.2 spun quite a burst of activity to include new functionality for
   this release.
 - We have to retake conversation on releasing 2.10.2. There shouldn't be
   too much trouble with it.
  
## Health report:
 - As said before, it has been a quiet quarter, but this happens from time
   to time; all JSPWiki developers work on it on their free time, plus this
   quarter we've had few questions on MLs, hence little activity.
 - There is still plenty enough people to answer questions / vote on
   new releases, etc., though.
