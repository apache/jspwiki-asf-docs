## Project Activity:
Almost no activity this quarter
- we missed our release train stop because there wasn't any new code since 
  last release.
- there has been a little bit of development after the release train stop 
  date, regarding JSPWIKI-1131 and dependency updates.
- we received a security vulnerability report, but was dismissed due to issue
  having been already reported.
- Infra asked us to migrate jspwiki-wiki.a.o to a newer vm image; progress 
  can be tracked at INFRA-20807.

## Community Health:
Although there is little activity, there's enough project oversight; questions 
get followed up on ML/Jira, and there's enough people to cut down a release.
