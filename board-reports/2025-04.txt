## Project Activity:
Activity this quarter has been around fixing two vulnerabilities mentioned
on the last report. We've contacted back the reporters and we will release
2.12.3 as soon as we have confirmation theyhave been effectively fixed.

Next stop will be switching to 3.0.0 (Jakarta + modern JDK). Ideally we
should release this version soon after 2.12.3, in order to support and fix 
vulnerabilities only on one branch.

## Community Health:
Work on latest master shows commits from 2 commiters.

No questions unanswered on MLs, although they continue to have very little 
traffic.
