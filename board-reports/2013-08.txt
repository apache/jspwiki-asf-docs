JSPWiki is a Java-based wiki engine

Anything the board should be aware of?
---------------------------------------
Still having some issues transferring the resources from Incubator to TLP; 
currently unable to edit the website, except but doing directly on 
production/ URL. Following up this issue with Infra: INFRA-6577, INFRA-6611,
INFRA-6492 and JSPWIKI-787.

We're also looking forward having a VM to host live (JSP)wikis with 
documentation, a sandbox and a general entry point to newcomers. 
Historically, these wikis have been were JSPWiki's community has built up. A
couple of JIRAs filed to follow up this issue with Infra: INFRA-6580,
INFRA-5588 and JSPWIKI-739. 

Hopefully by the time of the board meeting, these infra issues will have 
been resolved.
