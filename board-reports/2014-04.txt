Releases / Development

Last release on 1st Feb, 2014

As an effect of releasing 2.10.0, we've had several JIRAs raised,
accompanied by their corresponding patches, 5 of them already
on trunk.

A 2.10.1 release is being discussed at dev@jspwiki.apache.org, which
should fix a couple of issues found after 2.10.0; this release will 
also add the ability of loading plugins from an outside directory.

Aside from this, there is work in progress on a new template / UI for
JSPWiki and on having portable binaries.
