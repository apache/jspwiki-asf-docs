## Description:
 - A feature-rich and extensible WikiWiki engine built around the standard
JEE components (Java, servlets, JSP).
   
## Issues:
 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 - Finally, our new website was released, based on JSPWiki's Haddock template.

   have been three code pushes, regarding UI, fixing a bug and some work to
   ease the development of external parsers
