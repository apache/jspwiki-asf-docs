## Project Activity:
Activity this quarter has been mostly around reviewing and merging 
contributors' PRs. We also pushed some updates related to the the logic of 
inlining / downloading attachments, as a result of discussing our last
vulnerability report. 

This report was rejected, but we decided that having this additional 
functionality would make JSPWiki more securitly-friendlier.

There's another PR from a contributor with the switch to Jakarta 10, which 
would be the first step towards JSPWiki 3.

## Community Health:
Work on latest master shows commits from 1 commiter, which contains 3 pull 
requests from two different contributors.

No questions unanswered on MLs, although they continue to have little traffic.

Answering a Board comment on previous report:

```
cdutz:
I do see a large number of emails from the security team on the private list 
and all activity seems to be merging dependabot version updates. Is the 
project activly working on addressing the known issues?
```

Every time we get a vulnerability report we started a separate thread at 
private@j.a.o to discuss the issue. We get a weekly "your dependabot alerts for
this week" which highlight that we're using an old version of commons-http,
which has some associated CVEs, althought none of them are explotaible on 
JSPWiki. We try to address every security issue and push the appropiate 
releases as fast as we can, although JSPWiki being developed on free time(tm),
sometimes is not as fast as we would like.

Other than that, we have a slow development pace, so every push usually comes 
with a commit upgrading dependencies, some adviced by dependabot, some not.
