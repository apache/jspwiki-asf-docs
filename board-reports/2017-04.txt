## Description:
 - A feature-rich and extensible WikiWiki engine built around the standard
JEE components (Java, servlets, JSP).
   
## Issues:
 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 - This quarter, dev has mostly gone on UI bug fixing and refinements; also 
there has been some more general bug-fixing.

 - Work has finally started to move away from ASF CMS to a gitpubsub based 
one. New site is already developed at jspwiki-site git repo, with a Jenkins 
job to push any changes to the site, and awaiting at INFRA-13716 for the 
switch from the ASF CMS based site to this new one.

 - Once we have moved to the new Git-based site we plan to request that
http://jspwiki.apache.org/docs should serve our wiki instead of the site, 
with the following objetives in mind:
   * as we can make main index.html perform a redirect, our wiki effectively
     turns into our main site, allowing us to further showcase JSPWiki 
     (JSPWIKI-1030 related).
   * In the case of VM failure, wiki screwed or whatever failure that renders
     the wiki unusable, we still are in control and can switch to a static 
     backup site easily and fast.
   * javadocs are still served through the git site, so they will still be 
     browsable online.
