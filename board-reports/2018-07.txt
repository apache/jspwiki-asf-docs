## Description: 
 - A feature-rich and extensible WikiWiki engine built around the standard
JEE components (Java, servlets, JSP).
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 - 2.10.4 was released on May with better support for mobile devices on 
   Haddock, some important fixes regarding caches / ACLs and a few more 
   features and bugfixes.
 
 - 2.10.5 expected for August.
 
 - We received our first PR on Github. It didn't make it to master because of 
   that same fix being included as a part of a subsequent commit, but our first 
   interaction merits a mention.

 - New code has been mostly about fine-tuning Haddock template for mobile 
   devices; also a fix for the default template and smoothing the build/release
   process.
