## Project Activity:
Quiet period, with small developments pushed into master. Aiming for the 
2.12.0 release, the associated vote should start somewhere this week. This
release contains a fix for some XSS vulnerabilities that has been sitting
on master for a while now. We would like to thank Arnout Engelen from the
Security team for kindly following through this reports and ensuring they
are fixed and released on a reasonable time span.

This quarter we've also reviewed almost all of our pending PRs, and 
discarded a bunch of dependabot false positives.

Last release was 2.11.3 on 2022-08-02.

## Community Health:
Traffic on both MLs has decreased compared with last quarter, mostly 
reflecting PRs movement.

There is enough people appearing on the ML and providing project oversight.
