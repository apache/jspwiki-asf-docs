## Project Activity:
This quarter's project activity has revolved mostly around the following items
* The refactor of WikiEngine, one of the core classes of JSPWiki (JSPWIKI-120)
* The development of a public API for JSPWiki's custom extensions
  (JSPWIKI-303)
* Other bugfixes and improvements

Because of two first, we missed our release train stop this quarter, as in the
moment of releasing the master branch, it wasn't backwards compatible with
current 3rd party extensions. We should be able to release next quarter,
though.

The development of the public API also allowed us to add the possibility of
including custom managers on the Wiki Engine (JSPWIKI-806) and the ability of
swapping core JSPWiki classes (WikiContext, WikiEngine, WikiPage, etc.) with
custom ones through an SPI, bringing up JSPWiki pluggability another step up.

## Community Health:
There is enough oversight, with questions getting answered on MLs. The public
API sparkled a conversation on how / when to break backwards compatibility,
which ended up on specifying /clarifying our versioning proposal [#1].

We received one security report this quarter, but ended up rejecting it.

One pull request merged into master, with 3 people committing into master.

In order to foster / attract contributors, we also had an overhaul of
documentation related to different ways of extending / customizing JSPWiki:
- How to write plugins [#2]
- How to write filters [#3]
- How to write page providers [#4]
- Starting point for developing custom extensions [#5]
- JSPWiki's public API [#6]
- Adding / improving translations [#7], [#8]
