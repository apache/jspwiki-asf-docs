## Description: 

 - A feature-rich and extensible WikiWiki engine built around the standard
JEE components (Java, servlets, JSP).
   
## Issues: 

 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 

 - As opposed to last quarter, this one has been quieter. 2.11.0.M4 was 
released, fixing a few XSS vulnerabilities, and there's been a some work
towards 2.11.0.M5 which should be out on August.
   
## Health report: 

 - We've seen some spike of activity at users@j.a.o, no questions unanswered
on both mailing lists. We also received a couple of vulnerability reports, 
which are fixed on master and there was a third vulnerability caught by a 
committer, which is also fixed in master. Last but not least, we have an
external contribution waiting to be reviewed at JSPWIKI-1114; it should 
get merged before 2.11.0.M5. 

On the other hand, development has been mostly carried out by a single 
committer, although that's not totally uncommon on the history of the 
project.

TL-DR: project remains with enough oversight, usual slow pace of development
