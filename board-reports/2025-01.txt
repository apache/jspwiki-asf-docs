## Project Activity:
Activity this quarter has been mostly around reviewing and working on the
switch to Jakarta 10. Initially on a contributor's fork, the migrated code
is now living on the jakarta branch of the main git repo.

The main stopper in that branch is that we have to decide what to do with
some xmlrpc code, which has no upgrade path. Current options are 1) rewrite it
using the metaweblog API (sort of xmlrpc successor), 2) remove it all together
or 3) replace it with a proper REST API. Or perhaps 2) and then later on 3).
 
We've received a couple of vulnerability reports that are still under study,
but they will probably require to release 2.12.3 before switching to 3.0.0.

## Community Health:
Work on latest master shows commits from 1 commiter, which contains 1 pull 
request from one contributor and some dependency upgrades. Also, the jakarta
branch landed on december.

No questions unanswered on MLs, although they continue to have little traffic.
